                    <p>The biggest Game in History websitey</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Minecraft is the most popular video game of all time and has survived for over 15 years and
                        counting. This game has continued to captivate players. Originally a PC game, Minecraft has
                        been
                        ported to numerous platforms, now available on nearly every device
                        imaginable. From handheld consoles to stationary systems, countless machines have hosted
                        this
                        iconic game. But today, we’re focusing on one particular version. The version is now
                        referred to
                        as Minecraft Console Edition. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Minecraft on Consoles. A completely new Concept</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>People were unsure if this so-called "lite" version of Minecraft would be a success or a
                        total
                        flop. Initially, things didn’t look promising. The console version was based on an older
                        build
                        of the game and lacked key features, like infinite worlds and online multiplayer. If your
                        world
                        didn’t have a woodland mansion or ocean ruins, there was no way of getting cross-platform
                        play
                        or online multiplayer at the time. Yet, despite these limitations, no one could have
                        predicted
                        how much passion and love the console edition would get over the next few years.

                    <p> Divide and Conquer</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The creator of Minecraft, Notch originally stated that Minecraft was only being released on
                        the
                        Xbox 360. However, it soon became clear that this game was far too big to stay contained on
                        one
                        console. Later the game was ported to PS3, PSVita/PS TV, and WiiU. Nintendo Switch, Xbox
                        One,
                        and PS4 did get their versions too, however, these were discontinued and instead replaced
                        with
                        Bedrock Edition.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Quality or Quantity? Why not Both?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Developed and updated by 4J Studios, a third-party game development studio known for their
                        expertise, this version introduced many features not found in any other Minecraft version.
                        Key
                        additions included tutorial worlds, Mini Games, and an extensive skin library. 4J Studios
                        knew
                        how to improve the game, and they eventually introduced online multiplayer, allowing up to 8
                        players to cplay online. A major milestone for the console edition.</p>
